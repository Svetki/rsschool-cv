![Hello, World](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/2f/c1/3a2fc1dbbb70971e9ee3faa67ffc3e98.jpg "Here I am")

I've never coded until this fall. I've recently started to learn web-development in EPAM's laboratory. I studied some basics things in HTML, CSS and JavaScript last week. And I'm going to learn more.

>As I've found out, programming is the world where you must learn something new every day. And I like it, because I persue this goal all my life.

Now I'm getting professional skills and enjoying communication with intelligent and flexible people. The decision to change my career is very important to me, because now I have a new dream. I'm going to create a really good and useful product.
